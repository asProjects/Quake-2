# Quake-2 VS2015
Quake 2 GPL Source Release

This is the Visual Studio 2015 build of Id Software's Quake 2 Source Code. The aim of this project is to study the 
architecture of Quake 2 Engine and possibly, to replace its opengl rendering engine with a modern DirectX12/Vulkan 
based rendering engine that I am developing in order to make an interactive demo for my engine.

The repository contains completely configured VS2015 solution for windows version of the game, one can build the projects in VS 2015,
add orignal game's assets in th output folder to play the game.

The build was possible with the help of a series of video tutorials titled "Building Quake-2 With Visual Studio 2013" 
made by Philip Buuck (Creator of Handmade Quake)
